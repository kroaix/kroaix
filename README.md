<h3> :woman: About Me </h3>
<p>I grew up in a very technically inclined family. I was around 10 years old when I discovered my mom's CSS and HTML books, and that was what piqued my interest.</p>

<p>Over the years, I learned as much as I could on my own before deciding to enroll in University to pursue a career in Web Development. Throughout my degree program I sought out opportunities to improve and apply my technical skills by creating logos and websites. I graduated in October 2016 with my Bachelors of Science in Web Design and Development.</p>

<p>In 2015, I moved from Connecticut to Kentucky for a job opportunity with imavex, a web development and marketing company. At imavex, I worked as a content specialist. Although my passion is for web development and coding, this gave me invaluable experience in the industry. I helped the project management team at imavex with content, migration, and cleanup of written code while utilizing their in-house CMS.</p>

<p>I then enrolled at Lambda School and later graduated in November 2020. While I was enrolled I worked as a Team Lead mentoring a team of students. I learned a great deal at Lambda School. I led 1:1 meetings where I reviewed their code and gave them feedback and held standup meetings at the end of each day. I am now confident that I am ready to move into a position where I can utilize the full range of knowledge and skills I've obtained over the years. Contact me to find out how I can add value to your team!</p>
